# Git & GitHub Overview

## Introduction
**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes.  

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing collaboration features such as pull requests, issues, project management, and more.

## History

### Git
- **Created by:** Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux)
- **Year:** 2005
- **Reason:** Linux kernel development needed a fast, reliable, distributed version control system after the discontinuation of BitKeeper.
- **Key Features:**
  - Distributed system – every developer has a full copy of the repository
  - Fast performance for commits, branching, and merging
  - Strong support for non-linear development with branches and merges
  - Data integrity ensured through SHA-1 hashing

### GitHub
- **Founded by:** Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett
- **Year:** 2008
- **Purpose:** Provide a web-based interface for Git repositories to facilitate collaboration, social coding, and project management.
- **Key Features:**
  - Hosting of Git repositories
  - Pull requests and code reviews
  - Issues and project boards for task tracking
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Social features: following developers, starring repositories

## Key Concepts

### Git
- **Repository (Repo):** A directory or storage space where your project lives.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of changes in the repository.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of the repository to work independently.
- **Merge:** Combine changes from different branches.
- **Clone:** Copy a repository to your local machine.
- **Push & Pull:** Upload changes to remote repo / fetch changes from remote repo.

### GitHub
- **Fork:** Copy someone else's repo to your account for independent development.
- **Pull Request (PR):** Propose changes from your branch/fork to be merged into the original repository.
- **Stars:** Bookmark repositories for reference or appreciation.
- **Issues:** Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
- **Actions:** Automate workflows such as testing, building, and deploying code.
